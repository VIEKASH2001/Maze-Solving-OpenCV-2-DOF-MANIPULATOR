Welcome to the Maze-Solving-OpenCV-2-DOF-MANIPULATOR GitHub repository!

This project is focused on solving simple mazes using contour detection and image processing techniques. We use OpenCV library for Python to detect the maze and extract its coordinates. Then, the coordinates are sent to an Arduino microcontroller using serial communication to control a 2 DOF manipulator and solve the maze in real-time.

Our team conducted a workshop on this project in our college, and we are now sharing the code and documentation for everyone interested in exploring this exciting field of image processing and robotics. In this repository, you will find the source code, data sets, and documentation required to replicate our work and build upon it.

Feel free to explore the repository and give feedback or suggestions. We hope this project inspires you to develop new and exciting applications for image processing and robotics.
